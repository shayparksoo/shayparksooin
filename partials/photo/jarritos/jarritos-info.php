            <h3>Information & Image Gathering</h3>
            <p class="card-body padding-49-r">Based on the concept, I collected reference images that had solid coloured backgrounds with props. Finding reference images was not difficult to find as there were many similar product advertisements for this concept. Here, I realized that the same or slightly hued colours of the beverage were used for the background colour. This helped me on deciding which colour to match and select the flavour. From the research, I decided where and how to place my beverage with the background element.</p>
