            <h3>Screener Testing</h3>
            <p class="card-body padding-49-r">As an individual, our group members came up with 10-15 screener questions that can narrow down intro appropriate candidates for the project. The questions were related specially to the candidateâ€™s previous experience, interest with charity, and the physical environment they are living at.</p>
            <p class="card-body padding-49-r p-break"> As a group, we merged our questions into 10 final questions and used Google Forms to initiate the questionnaires.</p><br>
            <h3 class="h3-break">User Testing</h3>
            <p class="card-body padding-49-r">As a group, we selected 6 testers based on their residential ability to have pets, previous experience having pets, and volunteer experience. Then we organized a moderated test through zoom with one member rotating as a moderator for each tester. Other two members acted as observers and recorded oral and body behaviors of the testers using a Rainbow Spreadsheet. We additionally asked 3 questionnaires to further understand the through process and impression of the test.</p>
