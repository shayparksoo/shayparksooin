            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p class="card-body padding-49-r">An unmoderated user testing was conducted for both of interfaces. For both testings, there weren't any significant problem that was critical to user interaction. For mobile version, a misclick happend the most on tapping the sign up text. I assumed the misclick occured because the text was difficult to tap given its size and the proximity with the log in button and "Forgot Your Password" option. For desktop version, testers found the button sizes to be difficult to use because of its size and spacing with one another. I fixed this problem by increasing the container size of the button and adding more padding between each button. </p>
