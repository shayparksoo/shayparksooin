            <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
            <p class="card-body">I wanted to develop a clothing merchandise website that users can find information of sustainable material products and purchase items. I aimed to deliver simple and user-friendly process of the user sign-up and product check-out. My target audience was people in age between 16 to 40 who are interested in reducing waste and buy recycled products. The goal of end user was to be informed about the companyâ€™s involvement in the eco-friendly movement and fulfill their need of finding an item.</p>
