            <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
            <p class="card-body">I wanted to develop a clothing merchandise website that users can find information of sustainable material products and <b>purchase</b> items. I aimed to deliver simple and user-friendly process of the user sign-up and product check-out. My target audience was people in age between 16 to 40 who are interested in reducing waste and buy recycled products. The goal of end user was to be <b>informed about the companyâ€™s involvement</b> in the eco-friendly movement and fulfill their need of <b>purchasing an item</b>.</p>
