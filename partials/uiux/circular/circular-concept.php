            <h3>Concept & Ideas</h3>
            <p class="card-body padding-49-r">The concept of the website was to be minimal and professionally built. This was to break the stereotype of sustainable material products which referred to low-quality or unaesthetic products. I thought of existing brands like Oak and Fort and Artizia which people would consider as a good quality-built products. As for sustainable products, I researched into Nike and Everlane as they offer products made sustainable material. This helped to me to understand why brands would be engage in eco-friendly environment and how they present to customers.</p>
