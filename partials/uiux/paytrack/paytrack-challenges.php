                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p class="card-body padding-49-r">The challenge I faced during this project was the <b>user interaction</b> within the interface. I had to research various versions of same feature to decide which is the best solution for users to easily use on devices. For instance, a carousel feature to show existing cards would able users to see all their cards at once and reduce the space that is unnecessary.</p>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p class="card-body padding-49-r">For future improvment, I would like to perform a <b>user testing</b> to build a real user experience iteration. A user testing would give me data which locates the pain points of users such as the requirements they have as they use the interface and the flow of the interaction.</p>
