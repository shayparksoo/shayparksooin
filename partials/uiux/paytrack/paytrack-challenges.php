                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p class="card-body padding-49-r">The challenge of this project was identifying how to <b>show features</b> that will <b>help user experience</b> with a device that is restricted with space.</p>
                <p class="card-body padding-49-r p-break">For example, given that the user would use the app on a smartphone device, I thought about what type of features would be <b>useful</b> when looking at several different apps that also have the name, description, and deadline of the payment. </p>
                    
                <p class="card-body padding-49-r p-break">For this particular problem, I used a <b>carousel</b> feature to show upcoming subscriptions which enable users to see all their cards through swiping and also reducing the space that is unnecessary.</p>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p class="card-body padding-49-r">This challenge and thinking process made me grow in how I can bring in a user's perspective in to a feature that they can <b>benefit from</b>. First, it can't be complicated as users would fallback if they have to learn how it works. Second, it has to advocate what the application is doing, which is in this case is to make a user's life habit stress-free.</p>
                <p class="card-body padding-49-r p-break">
                For future improvement, I would like to perform a <b>user testing</b> to build a real user experience iteration. A user testing would give me data which locates the pain points of users such as the requirements they have as they use the interface and the flow of the interaction.</p>
