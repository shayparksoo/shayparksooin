            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p class="card-body">The main users are waitresses and waiters of the restaurant as they receive, input, and organize  orders. The usersâ€™ age varies between 16 to late 50s. From this, I concluded that the design needs to be learnable at every age by using simplicity, consistency, and clarity.</p>

            <h3>Design System</h3>
            <p class="card-body">Overall, the design has a rounded corner in cards, buttons, and font style to give familiarity and easy-to-follow lines. I referenced Material Design System for font sizes to locate the hierarchy. The spacious design style was to implement simplicity and clarity as the software will be seen on a small screen of a tablet. I used small use of colour to increase the focus on the interface</p>
