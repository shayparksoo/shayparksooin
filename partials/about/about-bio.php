            <p class="sec-body-sm p-break">I was born in Seoul, South Korea but lived in Vancouver for more than years I lived there. When I was little, I loved to play outdoors like soccer and basketball with boys. When I was a teen, I loved to play instruments and sing melodies.</p>
            <p class="sec-body-sm p-break"> Growing up from childhood, I got to experience the magical moment of a musical as a media editor at the church where I volunteer. To think back, design was always near me whether I noticed or not--decorating a friend's photo album using Photoshop or making event highlight videos with a Windows video player.</p>
