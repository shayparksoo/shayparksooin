            <h3>Poster Creation</h3>
            <p class="card-body">After a good reference image was found, I started tracing with the main character. The process moved to the remaining characters and background elements. The reference image takes more characters; however, after the conversation with my instructor, the characters were limited to 3 characters, and decrease in the height of the poster was. The poster was completed by only using the Illustrator software.</p>
