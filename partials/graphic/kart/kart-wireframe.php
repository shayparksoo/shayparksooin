            <h3>Wireframe</h3>
            <p class="card-body">I used Figma to work on creating the lofi and hifi wireframes. Lofi wireframes were done in hand for mobile and digitally for desktop. This was to try out various ways to enhance the work process. With the lofi wireframe, I worked on producing layouts, placing a text holder and image holder, and adding design assets using Figma. The skeleton of the design In hifi wireframes, the text holder and image holder were replaced with real contents. Also, interaction like hover effect on buttons was added for prototype.</p>
            <p class="card-body">The challenge of creating wireframes was to have a valid user flow along with appropriate design layout for users to be satisfied from their visit. I had to think about user's interaction on the website such as which section they would be interested to see first in navigation, how much space is needed for users to increase the readability and the feedback they would expect as they navigate through the checkout process. After the lofi wireframes were done, user testing was initiated to find what real users felt and how they interacted with the interface. My problem was that the spaces were too small between colour buttons which made users to click on different colours. This was solved through expanding the margins between the buttons.</p>
